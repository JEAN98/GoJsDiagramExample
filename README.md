# GoJsDiagramExample
It's a little project about GoJs, where users can save their diagrams like json or svg file.
On other hand the diagram is going to show tree figures, yellow diamond that means primary key, a blue code that means foreign key and finally you are going to see a green box that means an simple attribute from that table.
You can run this project on Firefox or IE 11. 
I hope you like it.
